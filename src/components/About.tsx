          This app consists of a note-keeper where you can create your own notes
          and save them. 
          <br/>
          Maybe it's an important thought, a shopping list, or
          even a cooking recipe your grandma taught you. Anythingâ€”you can save
          it in this app. You can even add categories to them and file them away
          when you don't need them.

            This is an application made by me, Jeremias Oviedo, as part of a
            small project that I'm working on. This project doesn't have any
            other value than my own learning and enjoyment, and its purpose is
            to be a playground where I can learn things and apply them.
